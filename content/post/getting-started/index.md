## Overview

1. I started writing personal blog in August 2019. The purpose of my blog is to make my own study notes, because the process of writing allows me to organize my thoughts and better understand what I have learned. And because I am a person with a very bad memory, I need to review my notes frequently at work, so I started writing a personal technical blog.
2. At first I found a beautiful **Hexo template** on the Internet. Since **Github Page** is a popular hosting solution for free personal blogs, I also use **Github Page** + **Hexo** to build my blog according to online examples.
3. The problem is, I have a few computers, and I will use these computers back and forth to deal with work and study, and to write blogs. It is a bit troublesome to synchronize the content of the blog on several computers, because my Hexo is installed on the local computer, which makes it necessary for me to frequently compress the content generated by Hexo and put it on a USB disk. Sometimes it is inevitable to forget or make a mistake in operation.

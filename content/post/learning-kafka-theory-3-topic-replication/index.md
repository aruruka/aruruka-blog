summary: >-
  As you've seen, Kafka is a distributed system.


  We may have three Brokers or one hundred Brokers, so this is distributed.


  So, when there's a distributed system in the big data world, we need to have replication, such as,


  if a machine goes down, then the things still work, and replication does that for us.
